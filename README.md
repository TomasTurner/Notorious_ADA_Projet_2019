# Alcohol legislation, what works and what doesn’t?

## Abstract
Harmful use of alcohol causes more than 5% of the global disease burden. The death of more than [3 million people](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/21-09-2018-harmful-use-of-alcohol-kills-more-than-3-million-people-each-year--most-of-them-men) a year is caused by the substance. Simultaneously it is source of a [1344 billion dollar industry](https://www.statista.com/statistics/696641/market-value-alcoholic-beverages-worldwide/), and an important cultural factor. This makes it a highly important, and highly complex, matter for regulators which have to take into account many aspects when creating policies.
Alcohol control policies exist since many years, from taxes to total bans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has gathered significant amount of data on both alcohol consumption and related policies in different countries. This data can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the policies, building upon [existing work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876414/). This evaluation could then be used by policymakers to decide which policy fits best their goals.

## Research questions
* What kind of legislation is the most common in which type of country?
* What legislations are the most efficient in reducing alcohol consumption?
* What legislations are the most efficient in decreasing alcohol related diseases and deaths?

Group ideas: We do a generalise analysis and a deep analysis of each own’s country (Switzerland, China, Ukraine, France) for culture or other explanations.
